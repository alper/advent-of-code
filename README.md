# Advent of Code

Repository where I keep my solutions for the past couple of years of Advent of Code.

* [2019](https://github.com/alper/advent-of-code/tree/main/2019) - The year where I started while learning Haskell properly. I finally wanted to know what monads wre about and I found out. It went well but still I found the Haskell environment and type system to be offputting and not very relevant so after a while I switched to Clojure (which I also had to learn). That was very enjoyable.
* [2020](https://github.com/alper/advent-of-code/tree/main/2020) - The year where I thought I'd do the advent while at the same time learning Rust. Chewed my way through the O'Reilly book while also finishing the assignments in the evening. Doing the parsing assignment in [Nom](https://github.com/Geal/nom) took me multiple evenings and nearly killed me. I did manage to get far and finish the book.
* [2021](https://github.com/alper/advent-of-code/tree/main/2021) - The year where I thought I'd do it in either Racket or Julia but then reconsidered and thought I'd take it easy on myself and build on existing knowledge. This was a repeat in Rust which proved to be so much easier to write than last year, it's just the advent itself which was incredibly more difficult than last time round.
